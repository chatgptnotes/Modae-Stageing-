# Manual browser and device smoke checklist

`npm test` covers the logic; this covers what only a person at a screen can see.
Start each scenario from a clean **Reset all demo data** (Demo Launcher or Admin).
Record browser, viewport, role, result and console errors.

## The two journeys the client walked on 13 Aug

**As RS (sales owner) — this is the run that used to fail.**

1. Lead Inbox → open a lead. Qualify, Disqualify and Reassign are all on the lead.
2. Disqualify → Confirm stays disabled until a reason is typed. Cancel out.
3. Qualify → Create Opportunity. Type into every text field: **focus must not jump
   after each keystroke.** Select two or more Products; BU and Segment stay single.
4. Submit → the tracker row shows both products, and Expected Order / Ship Date
   are outlined amber until filled.
5. Open the proposal. **Priced BoQ is visible and editable.** Extract to Excel is
   there. Print / PDF shows prices.
6. Email proposal → To is already filled, Subject is built, CC is available,
   Preview shows the real document, and the attachment wording matches what
   actually happens.
7. Request approval → the sidebar Approvals badge counts it.

**As LJS (approver).** My Dashboard shows the gate queue and company attainment.
Approve with a condition; back as RS, confirm the condition in the modal — no
browser prompt, no localhost URL.

## Per role

- Sign in as RS, PP, LJS, AH, ADMIN, SUPER, TECH, CUST.
- CUST is redirected to `/portal` only.
- `/my-dashboard` renders a different, populated page for each internal role.
  TECH must not land on an empty sales dashboard.
- Verify My View / Global View is in the top bar on desktop and tablet routes,
  stays selected while navigating, and filters each owner-based list. Dashboard
  navigation remains labeled Dashboard. Existing role permissions must still
  limit which pages and records are visible.
- Check owner, FY/quarter, search, pagination, and funnel-stage filters. A funnel
  click must filter the on-page register; zero-count stages have no visible bar.
- Check the dashboard at desktop and phone widths, refresh/error feedback, and
  keyboard controls. Verify the default FY, numeric team targets, quarter labels,
  and numbered pagination. Task deadlines must not use expected close dates.
  Open the register menu → “More reports & settings” and confirm proposal
  follow-up, monthly reporting, and permitted target editing still work.

- On Price Lists, verify catalogue, service-rate, and ad-hoc tables show all
  matching rows without pagination. Search the catalogue and open a direct part
  link beyond the tenth row; verify the matching part scrolls into view.
- As LJS and ADMIN, edit a supplier list, cancel once, then save a new version;
  verify prior versions remain available and refresh retains the new values.
  Edit India and International service rates separately, including minimum
  callout and GST; Cancel must discard changes and Save must add an audit entry.
  Empty/negative amounts and GST over 100 must block Save. Check desktop/mobile.
  SUPER, AH, and RS must have no edit controls on Price Lists; SUPER must also
  have read-only pricing controls in Admin. Other Admin settings remain usable.

## Route-driven proposals

- A Spares opportunity: no Signal List or Rack Layout tab; the printed document
  is short and has no contents page or company profile.
- A Services opportunity: prints "Scope of work" and "Schedule of charges".
- A Project opportunity: unchanged, full section set.
- An AMC or Training opportunity must not print the project template.

## Extraction

- Upload a tender PDF **and** a `.eml` from `.local/documents/modae-doc/`. Both are accepted.
- RFQ number and date land in the form; with no reference, RFQ Number reads
  "Email dated …".
- Fields the document did not contain are outlined amber on the field.

## Demo Launcher

- Scenarios 1, 2, 3 and 5 from a clean reset.
- Scenario 6 opens on a PO already in review — no "Simulate" click needed first.
- Scenario 4 is the deferred project deep-dive.

## Removing the demo data (do this last — it empties the app)

The three call sites carry the same pair of buttons: sidebar footer, Admin
toolbar, Demo Launcher housekeeping.

- **Remove demo data** → confirm. Tracker, Inbox, Approvals, Customers, PO and
  My Dashboard all come back empty, with no console errors and no blank screen.
- Admin still lists the users and every configuration card; Price Lists still
  shows the B&K catalogue; the "DUMMY — replace with actual" upload is gone.
- **Reload the page.** Still empty. This is the check that matters — the demo
  leads (LD-203…LD-207) and AP-1 used to reappear on every boot.
- Sign out and back in with a seeded account (`Demo@1234`) — the logins survived.
- New → file an enquiry. "Sell To Customer" accepts a name that is not in the
  master yet. Save, reload: the enquiry is still there.
- Inbox → "Simulate incoming inquiry" still works on the empty app.
- Demo Launcher → the scenario tiles are dimmed and disabled, with the restore
  notice above them.
- **Restore demo data** → confirm. The full seeded dataset is back (anything
  entered in between is discarded — that is intended).
- With Supabase configured, repeat on a second browser: it must come up empty
  after a Remove rather than pushing its own seeds back to the server.

## AI & Automation

- Every row badges Live AI / Rule-based / Preview, and "Open in demo" lands where
  that thing actually happens.
- Customer health scores on `/customers`, hover shows the reasons.
- `/inbox/LD-207` flags LD-201 as a duplicate.

## Mobile and tablet — 390×844 and 768×1024

- Open the shared link from WhatsApp; install as a Chrome PWA and relaunch.
- **My Dashboard is on the bottom tab bar** — reachable without typing a URL.
- No horizontal page scroll anywhere. Tables scroll inside their own container.
- Rotate the device: the layout follows, unless "Full site" was chosen.
- Modal actions stay visible above the bottom navigation.

## Approval gate and PO handover

- **Handover opens on the joint signature.** On an opportunity with a PO received,
  accept the PO as LJS, switch the role to AH and accept again — the Handover
  milestone opens instead of holding on "PO must be jointly accepted".
- **A revision re-opens approval.** Build a proposal → Submit for approval → approve
  the Final quote release on `/approvals` → confirm the Submission panel unlocks.
  Then click **Revise quote** on the builder, give a reason, and confirm:
  - Submit for approval is enabled again (subject to the readiness blockers),
  - the Submission panel returns to "Release approval pending",
  - the revisions list shows the new R-entry with the reason,
  - the opportunity is back on the Proposal milestone,
  - the audit trail records "Quote revision opened".

## The two journeys from the 20 August review

`npm test` pins the logic for both; these are the parts only a person at a screen
can confirm. Both start from a clean **Reset all demo data**.

### Journey 1 — the Red-class approval that could never clear

This is the bug the client reproduced on the call: both approvers said yes and the
opportunity ID still read `— withheld —`.

1. As **RS**, open `/inbox/LD-206` (CAPSA Dubai / Realix). The red box names AP-1
   and offers **Request joint approval**. Raise it.
2. Switch to **LJS** → `/approvals` → approve AP-1. Go back to LD-206: the gate is
   still open. One approver is not enough, and the box must still say so.
3. Switch to **AH** → approve AP-1. LD-206 now shows the green "Red gate cleared"
   box naming the approval and its status.
4. As RS, qualify the lead and continue to registration. **The opportunity ID must
   be a real `YYMM…RS` value, not `— withheld —`**, and Create opportunity must be
   enabled.
5. Open the new opportunity → Customer/KYC. Its lead-stage verification must record
   the clearance — approval id and both deciding roles — not "Verification was not
   required".
6. Return AP-1 instead of approving it on a second lead: the inbox must offer
   **Re-request joint approval**, not a dead end.

### Journey 2 — the spares benchmark, enquiry 14716

The client's yardstick. The enquiry (`02_7425309-Buyers Speces.pdf`, "Ref:14716")
and the proposal that answered it (`Spares Firm Offer Rev00 2May2026.xlsx`,
Our Ref 2511096RS) are retained with the local reference documents.

1. Demo Launcher → **Spares benchmark — enquiry 14716** (scenario 1, persona RS).
2. The lead shows five B&K line items and two open questions (delivery address,
   bid submission date).
3. Click **Draft clarification email**. Confirm the From line reads the **common
   mailbox** and says the lead is not assigned yet. The body must ask for both
   missing items.
4. Assign the lead to RS and click **Re-draft email**. The From must now be
   `rs@modae.demo` with the common mailbox on CC.
5. Press **Send**. A compose window opens — *nothing has been sent yet*. Close it
   without sending and confirm the lead still records the mail as Sent from the
   click (that stamp is the human's action, not a dispatch).
6. Register the lead. Price the BoQ: all five part codes must resolve to real B&K
   list prices, not zero.
7. Open the proposal preview. Check the eight numbered terms against the sample:
   Ex Works Bangalore (not FCA), freight to the customer's account, **16 weeks
   after PO and advance payment**, and **50/50 payment** (not 100% advance).

### Brand identity — check on any screen

- Nothing sky-blue or navy survives: chrome is ModAE red `#ED3F2F` on charcoal
  `#282828`.
- Headings and body render in **Candara** where the system provides it, with the
  documented fallback stack on other platforms.
- Buttons are 7px-radius, primary is red with white text, **Danger is a distinct
  red** so a destructive action never reads as a primary button.
- Prices show a real `₹` glyph, not a fallback-font one. (That is the latin-ext
  subset doing its job.)
- Tablet view stays on the permanent light ModAE palette; nothing switches to
  a dark surface.

### Responsive wrapping and zoom — check on desktop and tablet

- At 80%, 100%, 125%, 150%, 200%, and 400% browser zoom, long customer names,
  URLs, filenames, IDs, and pasted descriptions wrap inside their cards or cells.
- Toolbars, filters, headers, metadata rows, and action groups wrap or stack;
  no controls overlap or force the whole page sideways.
- Wide tables scroll horizontally inside their local table container; the page
  itself does not gain an unexpected horizontal scrollbar.
- On Opportunities, both key and all-column views stay as tables at high zoom
  and narrow widths. Scroll within the grid; verify IDs, probability, both date
  columns, and native date pickers remain readable and editable.
- At the wide desktop reference width, all 11 key columns fit without a
  horizontal scrollbar; switching views returns the grid to its left edge.
- Inputs, selects, buttons, images, and modal content stay within their parent
  bounds at each zoom level.

### Monthly bookings chart — My Dashboard

- **One** card titled "Monthly bookings", not two.
- All twelve months Apr–Mar are labelled along the axis (sparsely — Apr, Jun, Aug,
  Oct, Dec, Feb, Mar).
- The **dotted** target line runs the full year; the **solid** actual line stops at
  the current month and does not flatline along zero to March.

## Workspace appearance

- Switch light/dark in the desktop header and tablet/phone More → Appearance;
  verify the selection follows layout
  changes, navigation, reloads, and another open tab. With storage blocked,
  switching still works for the current session; a fresh session defaults light.
- In both themes and desktop/mobile widths, inspect Dashboard, Lead inbox,
  Opportunities, Approvals, Workbench, Documents, Customers, Price Lists, Admin,
  and Users. Check headings, tables, charts, inputs, keyboard focus, selections,
  hover and disabled states, and labelled success/warning/error/info badges.
- Open an inbox header filter, customer picker, guide, record drawer, and modal.
  Body-mounted overlays must match the active workspace theme.
- With dark selected, verify sign-in and `/showcase` stay light; switching back
  to the authenticated workspace restores dark. Proposal/workbook paper and
  attachment content retain document colours; print preview stays light.
- After deployment cleanup, verify sign-out and appearance reset to light.
# Phone workspace

- At 360px and 390px, verify Inbox cards, advanced filter disclosure, selection,
  pagination, local search, new enquiry, and opening a lead.
- Open an opportunity card; switch to Edit in table, change column view, expand
  and close the table, then return to cards. Verify filters match both views.
- Check More search and role-filtered destinations, including Proposal Sent
  and Workflow Admin. Confirm refresh feedback and disabled pending refresh.
- Open More from a record and switch to Full site; verify the same record URL.
- Check phone forms and dialogs with the keyboard open and safe-area padding;
  rotate to landscape and verify the chosen mode persists.
